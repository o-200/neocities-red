# Neocities Red

Hello, there is a fork of [neocities-ruby gem](https://github.com/neocities/neocities-ruby) with my own features and implementations. A much of my changes doesn't make sense to be pushed into original repository, so i pushed it here.

## Main changes/Features:

### Currently, this gems tests with ruby 3.4.*, it doesn't supports ruby 4 due of dependencies

1) Added MultiThread uploading of files to neocities. This feature boosts `neocities push`;
2) Moves from `http.rb` to `faraday` gem;
3) Fixed `-e` flag to exclude folders recursively;
4) Added `--ignore-dotfiles` to ignore all files-folders starts with '.';
5) Added `--optimized` for `neocities push` flag to upload only modified files;
6) Fixed bug with neocities info on modern rubies;
7) Re-designed `upload` method;

## TODO'S:
1) Check all entire cli and client logic, fix bugs.
2) Change dependencies for modern analogs.
3) Refactor `cli.rb` or use `rails/thor` gem instead.
4) Add tests
5) Make sure that gem is compatible with Linux, Freebsd, Windows
6) Make it compatible with ruby 4.0.0

After that, you are all set! Run `neocities-red` in a command line to see the options and get started.

## Gem modules

This gem also transpose all processes to several class in lib/neocities, which could be used to write code that interfaces with the Neocities API.

# use api key
params = {
  api_key: 'MyKeyFromNeocities'
}

# or sitename and password
# params = {
#  sitename: 'petrapixel,
#  password: 'mypass'
# }

client = Neocities::Client.new(params)
client.key
client.upload(path, remote_path)
client.info(sitename)
client.delete(path)
client.push(path)
client.list(path)
```
